Deligates and Events: 
    In c# Deligates and Events are used to implement event driven programming GUI. 

Deligates: 
    Deligates is a type that represent references to method with special parameters and return value. 

    //syntax 
    public deligate void MyDeligate(string message); 

    public void showMessage(string message)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(message);
    }

    //use 
    MyDeligate del = showMessage; 
    del("Hello from deligates);

    -> Deligate is a type save function pointer 
    -> It can point both static and instance methods 
    -> It supports multicasting(invoing multiple methods)

Events: 
-> An event is a wrapper around deligate and is used to singnal that something has happened. 
-> Event provide a way to subscribe and respond to action 
-> Only the class that declares events can raise it. 
-> Other classes can only subscribe to the events like -=, +=
